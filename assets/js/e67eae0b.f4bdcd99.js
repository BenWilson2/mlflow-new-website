The new site landing page is fresh, modern, and contains more content than ever. We\'re adding new content and blogs all of the time.\\n\\n### Model Signature Supports Objects and Arrays (#9936, @serena-ruan)\\n\\nObjects and Arrays are now available as configurable input and output schema elements. These new types are particularly useful for GenAI-focused flavors that can have complex input and output types. See the new [Signature and Input Example documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model/signatures.html) to learn more about how to use these new signature types.\\n\\n### Langchain Autologging (#10801, @serena-ruan)\\n\\nLangChain has autologging support now! When you invoke a chain, with autologging enabled, we will automatically log most chain implementations, recording and storing your configured LLM application for you. See the new [Langchain documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/langchain/index.html#mlflow-langchain-autologging) to learn more about how to use this feature.\\n\\n### Prompt Templating for Transformers Models\\n\\nThe MLflow `transformers` flavor now supports prompt templates. You can now specify an application-specific set of instructions to submit to your GenAI pipeline in order to simplify, streamline, and integrate sets of system prompts to be supplied with each input request. Check out the updated [guide to transformers](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/index.html) to learn more and see examples!\\n\\n### MLflow Deployments Server Enhancement\\n\\nThe MLflow Deployments Server now supports two new requested features: (1) OpenAI endpoints that support streaming responses. You can now configure an endpoint to return realtime responses for Chat and Completions instead of waiting for the entire text contents to be completed. (2) Rate limits can now be set per endpoint in order to help control cost overrun when using SaaS models.\\n\\n### Further Document Improvements\\n\\nContinued the push for enhanced documentation, guides, tutorials, and examples by expanding on core MLflow functionality (Deployments, Signatures, and Model Dependency management), as well as entirely new pages for GenAI flavors. Check them out today!\\n\\n### Other Features:\\n\\n- [Models] Enhance the MLflow Models `predict` API to serve as a pre-logging validator of environment compatibility.

The release is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mlflow/) and docs are [updated](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html). Here are the release notes (also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.4.0)):\\n\\nBreaking changes:\\n\\n- [Projects] Removed the use_temp_cwd argument to mlflow.projects.run()\\n  (--new-dir flag in the mlflow run CLI). Runs of local projects now use the local project directory as their working directory. Git projects are still fetched into temporary directories (#215, @smurching)\\n- [Tracking] GCS artifact storage is now a pluggable dependency (no longer installed by default). To enable GCS support, install google-cloud-storage on both the client and tracking server via pip (#202, @smurching).\\n- [Tracking] Clients running MLflow 0.4.0 and above require a server running MLflow 0.4.0\\n  or above, due to a fix that ensures clients no longer double-serialize JSON into strings when sending data to the server (#200, @aarondav). However, the MLflow 0.4.0 server remains backwards-compatible with older clients (#216, @aarondav)\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n- [Examples] Add a more advanced tracking example: using MLflow with PyTorch and TensorBoard (#203)\\n- [Models] H2O model support (#170, @ToonKBC)\\n- [Projects] Support for running projects in subdirectories of Git repos (#153, @juntai-zheng)\\n- [SageMaker] Support for specifying a compute specification when deploying to SageMaker (#185, @dbczumar)\\n- [Server] Added --static-prefix option to serve UI from a specified prefix to MLflow UI and server (#116, @andrewmchen)\\n- [Tracking] Azure blob storage support for artifacts (#206, @mateiz)\\n- [Tracking] Add support for Databricks-backed RestStore (#200, @aarondav)\\n- [UI] Enable productionizing frontend by adding CSRF support (#199, @aarondav)\\n- [UI] Update metric and parameter filters to let users control column order (#186, @mateiz)\\n\\nBug fixes:\\n\\n- Fixed incompatible file structure returned by GCSArtifactRepository (#173, @jakeret)\\n- Fixed metric values going out of order on x axis (#204, @mateiz)\\n- Fixed occasional hanging behavior when using the projects.run API (#193, @smurching)\\n- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from @aarondav, @andrewmchen, @arinto, @jakeret, @mateiz, @smurching, @stbof\\n\\nVisit the [change log](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#040-2018-08-01) to read about the new features."},{"id":"/2018/07/18/0.3.0-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/mlflow-website/releases/2018/07/18/0.3.0-release","source":"@site/releases/2018-07-18-0.3.0-release.md","title":"MLflow 0.3.0","description":"We are happy to announce the availability of MLflow 0.3.0!","date":"2018-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 18, 2018","tags":[],"readingTime":1.085,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"MLflow maintainers","title":"MLflow maintainers","url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git","imageURL":"https://github.com/mlflow-automation.png","key":"mlflow-maintainers"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"MLflow 0.3.0","authors":["mlflow-maintainers"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"MLflow 0.4.0","permalink":"/mlflow-website/releases/2018/08/01/0.4.0-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"MLflow 0.2.1","permalink":"/mlflow-website/releases/2018/06/28/0.2.1-release"}},"content":"We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 0.3.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.3.0)!\\n\\nMLflow Release 0.3.0 is ready, released 2018-07-18.
